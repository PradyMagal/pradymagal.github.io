## Hi, I'm Pradyun!


Hey guys! I am a software developer, app maker, and overall, geek!

I know a variety of programming languages including(but not limited to):

- Python
- Java and its frameworks(Flutter, Dart, etc.)
- JavaScript and its frameworks(React JS, React Native, Ionic, etc.)
- C/C#



## My Projects and Resume

I have made, and worked on quite a few projects/apps, 

**My full resume is [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-bteqsMhy7UjdY9hBJiIxjow8W1nQLutpTGUrYafuX0/)**
, but here is a much shortened version:

- [Bay Airea](https://pradymagal.github.io/BayAirea/)
- [Netsays](https://github.com/PradyMagal/Netsays)
- Compare'n Share
- [Compare](http://accelerate.im/projects/114)
- I made the website for my high school club, [Asian Student Union](https://asumvhs.org)

Most of them are open source, because we all know 

`
 if(code_is_free == true){
    console.log("Woot Woot!");
 }
`
