## Hi, I'm Pradyun!


Hey guys! I am a software developer, app maker, and overall, geek!

I know a variety of programming languages including(but not limited to):

- Python
- Java and its frameworks(Flutter, Dart, etc.)
- JavaScript and its frameworks(React JS, React Native, Ionic, etc.)
- C/C#



## My Projects

I have made, and worked one a few projects/apps, you can learn more about them here:

- [Bay Airea](https://pradymagal.github.io/BayAirea/)
- [LISTM](https://pradymagal.github.io/Listm/)
- Compare'n Share
- [Compare](http://accelerate.im/projects/114)

Most of them are open source, because we all know 

`
 if(code_is_free == true){
    console.log("Woot Woot!");
 }
`
